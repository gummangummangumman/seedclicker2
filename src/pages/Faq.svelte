	<h2>What is {GAME_NAME}?</h2>
	<p>
		{GAME_NAME} is a clicker/idle game. It is a sequel to
		<a
			class="underline text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 visited:text-purple-600"
			target="_blank"
			href="https://gumman.one/seedclicker/"
		>
			Seedclicker</a
		>, which is a simple clicker game from ~2016. {GAME_NAME} was released almost a decade later, and is a full rewrite
		with new features. Both games are developed by GuMMaN.
	</p>
	<h2>What is new compared to Seedclicker?</h2>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li>Save files üíæ</li>
		<li>Offline progress üïí</li>
		<li>Mobile friendly design üì±</li>
		<li>Dark mode üåô</li>
		<li>Gradual discovery of game upgrades ‚ú®‚¨ÜÔ∏è</li>
		<li>Several game features that you have to unlock by playing! üéÆüåª</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What do the abbreviations mean?</h2>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li><strong>Cp</strong> - Clickpower, {getCurrencyName()} awarded per click</li>
		<li><strong>{getSpsName()}</strong> - {getLongSpsName()}</li>
	</ul>
	{#if store.gameState.harvested.harvestCount > 0}
		<h2>Why is my harvest multiplier not working?</h2>
		<p>
			Harvest multiplier is not shown directly as {getSpsName()} or clickpower, but it is applied. The multiplication
			is always rounded down to the nearest whole number. For example if you have a <strong>1.8</strong>
			harvest multiplier, <strong>2</strong> clickpower would only gr*nt you <strong>3</strong>
			{getCurrencyName().toLowerCase()} each click as opposed to 3.6.
		</p>
		<h2>What determines the harvest multiplier I get on harvesting?</h2>
		<p>{getCurrencyName()} collected. It doesn't matter whether they are spent on upgrades or not</p>
	{/if}
	<h2>Do I have to click with my mouse?</h2>
	<p>If you play on a computer, you can also use the space or enter key to click</p>
	<h2>Will my game collect {getCurrencyName().toLowerCase()} while I don't have the game open?</h2>
	<p>
		Yes, as long as you have some <span title={getLongSpsName()}>{getSpsName()}</span>. You'll be greeted with a
		welcome screen upon opening the game again, saying how many {getCurrencyName().toLowerCase()} you've earned since
		last visit.
	</p>
	<h2>I didn't seem to get enough {getCurrencyName().toLowerCase()} after being in another tab?</h2>
	<p>
		The rewarding of {getCurrencyName().toLowerCase()} every second is unfortunately the least reliable when running
		the game in an inactive tab. If you want to be guaranteed progress, I suggest you either keep it as your active tab
		or close the website fully.
	</p>
	{#if store.gameState.harvested.talents.length > 0 || store.gameState.current.talents.length > 0}
		<h2>How do talents multiplications work?</h2>
		<p>
			Talents are always multiplicative, never additive. This means if you have 2 talents that both double your
			clickpower, you will have 4x. If you add another talent that adds 50%, you will have 4x+(50% * 4x) = 6x.
		</p>
	{/if}
	<h2>What can I do if I experience a bug?</h2>
	<p>
		You can get in touch with me on
		<a class="italic underline" href={`mailto:${GAME_SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{GAME_SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>, describe your bug,
		attach your game save if relevant, and I might look into it. No promises.
